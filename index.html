                Two days after Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed
                <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1606941/justice-isa-should-not-hear-matters-involving-pm-imran-says-cjp"
                    target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">dismissed a case</a> concerning
                allegations that the premier had distributed development funds among lawmakers, observing in the
                written
                order that Justice Qazi Faez Isa should not hear cases involving the premier, a letter from Justice
                Isa
                — who was part of the bench — to the apex court registrar expressed 'shock' that the judgement was
                released to the media before it was sent to him, it emerged on Saturday.
            </p>

            <p>
                The copy of a letter by Justice Isa to the Supreme Court registrar, dated February 12, surfaced
                today, in which the judge says that as per "settled practice" a judgement, once written by the judge
                heading the bench, is sent to the next senior-most judge.
            </p>
            <p>
                "[...] Honourable Mr Justice Ijazul Ahsan apparently received it, but I never did, and the world
                knows
                of
                it before I've seen it," the letter reads, which was also copied to the chief justice and all judges
                of
                the apex court. Justice Ahsan follows Justice Isa in seniority.
            </p>
            <p>
                The five-page written order, authored by the CJP, said it "would not be proper" for Justice Isa, who
                is
                slated to become chief justice in 2023, to hear cases against the prime minister as the judge has,
                in
                personal capacity, filed a petition against PM Imran Khan.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his letter to the registrar, Justice Isa raised four questions, along with the demand that the
                case
                file be sent to him so he could read it. The questions, quoted from the letter, are as follows:
            </p>
           
            <h3 class="sub-heading">CJP's remarks</h3>
            <p class="after-sub-heading">
                A five-member bench had taken up a case relating to the distribution of Rs500m uplift funds among
                the
                legislators.
            </p>
            <P>
                Prime Minister Imran had denied that the funds were distributed among the parliamentarians and said
                no
                money would be given to the legislators for carrying out any development scheme.
            </P>
            <P>
                But Justice Isa, a member of the five-judge special bench, questioned the assurance by presenting a
                WhatsApp message he said he had received from an unknown source on Wednesday. The message contained
                supporting documents showing doling out of massive amounts recently for building roads by the
                Pak-PWD
                department in the constituency NA-65 that belongs to an important coalition partner.
            </P>
            <P>
                The chief justice, however, disposed of the matter with an observation that there had been a contest
                between a judge and the prime minister.
            </P>
            <P>
                In the judgement, released on Thursday, the top judge had noted that since Justice Isa had, in
                personal
                capacity, filed a petition against PM Imran, it "would not be proper" for the former to hear cases
                involving the PM in order "to uphold the principle of un-biasness and impartiality".
            </P>
            <P>
                "It would be in the interest of justice that the honourable Judge [Justice Isa] should not hear
                matters
                involving the Prime Minister of Pakistan," the written order reads.
            </P>
